    <div id = "Favorite_Website">
    <h2> Favorite Website </h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/?client=safari" target ="_blank"> Google </a> is one of my favorite websites because I am always googl-ing everything I do not know, or can't come up with an answer for. Google is the world's leading web browser on the internet and at the stroke of your keys you can find any and all bits of information you need or want. </p>
<p> Another one of my favorite websites is <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target ="_blank"> YouTube </a> simply because I am always trying to find new videos about cars and planes in my freetime, as well as watching different DIY videos. YouTube is home to a wide range of profesionally made videos as well as homemade videos that anyone can upload to share their joy with you in various ways. </p>
